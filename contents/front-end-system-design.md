Front end system design resources are harder to come by and we are one of the pioneers of this topic.

"System" here typically refers to front end systems, which is quite different from the typical distributed system design questions for Software Engineering interviews. The questions asked can be quite similar to the possible questions in ["Build user interfaces" format](./build-front-end-user-interfaces.md) but with more focus on architecture and design. There's a significant amount of overlap between them - you will likely need to do some design (data model, API) when you build UI, and also do some coding here to illustrate your ideas/app state format.

The difference between this section and the ["Build user interfaces" format](./build-front-end-user-interfaces.md) is that the problems are usually of a larger scope. If the interview session does not exceed an hour, candidates are expected to talk about the design tradeoffs, possible implementations, instead of coding it out. Because system design questions usually involve multiple components and knowledge across the web stack, candidates usually do not have to go very deep into the lower-level details of each component and can keep the discussion at a higher level, focusing on API design between the client and server, the various front end components and their APIs/props.

Many of the topics mentioned in the ["Build user interfaces" format](./build-front-end-user-interfaces.md) are also relevant for front end system design - API design, scalability, performance, user experience, i18n, accessibility, security, etc. Candidates should take the initiative and bring these topics up and lead the discussion with the interviewer. The more advanced topics such as performance, accessibility and i18n are what differentiates senior candidates from junior candidates.

The two main kinds of front end system design interviews are **UI components** and **applications**.

## RADIO Framework

System design interview questions tend to be open ended and vague, leaving you with lots of room to explore. If the interviewer tells you which specific areas to focus on, that's great!

We have invented a simple-to-remember framework â€“ the **RADIO framework**, that you can use to give an outline to the interviewer as to what you are going to cover.

This framework is called **RADIO** because it is made up of the first character of each area. You can write this structure down on the whiteboard/online editor to remind yourself to cover each aspect (not necessarily in that order):

- **<u>R</u>equirements exploration**: Understand the problem thoroughly and determine the scope by asking a number of clarifying questions
- **<u>A</u>rchitecture / High-level design**: Identify the key components of the product and how they are related to each other
- **<u>D</u>ata model**: Describe the various data entities, the fields they contain and which component(s) they belong to
- **<u>I</u>nterface definition (API)**: Define the interface (API) between components in the product, functionality of each API, their parameters and responses
- **<u>O</u>ptimizations and deep dive**: Discuss about possible optimization opportunities and specific areas of interest when building the product

The RADIO framework is also helpful when working on new front end projects at work, especially when writing technical design documents. It's not limited to front end; the framework can also be applied to back end systems.

How to approach system design questions for applications and UI components can differ significantly, and we'll go through them in more detail in subsequent sections.

## Things you would not have to do (probably)

Because front end system design interviews focus on front end, you probably do not have to:

- Design a database schema
- Discuss which kind of database to use (SQL vs NoSQL)
- Discuss about scaling your servers and database (sharding, vertical/horizontal scaling)
- Discuss about availability, fault tolerance, latency, etc
